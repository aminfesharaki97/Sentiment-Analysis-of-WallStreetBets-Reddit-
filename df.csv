Lately short selling has been somewhat of a bit hot topic where a very active group of investors , mostly in meme stocks demonize all short sellers\n\nOne of the best examples of how short selling can lead to more efficient markets is this story ; and I cannot find the exact link or podcast I will be referring to because I don't exactly remember.\n\nAny way I cannot remember the podcast (oddlots or maybe animal spirits or another one) had a guest on who was basically a short seller and made the case why it can be good\n\nThe premise was this; when Chinese stocks were hot , they discovered this hot stock . Was up something like 500% in a few weeks. The stock was some sort of Chinese tutoring business what is big in china. Basically to get into top highs schools and colleges you have to earn top grades just to get a chance so lots of wealthy Chinese people will spend thousands and thousand on tutors to make sure their kids get placed in top schools so it seemed a good business model on the surface\n\nOnce the guy researched the stock a lot of stuff was not adding up, he knew basic Mandarin but not well, he saw the website but the first red flag was there was really no way to actually sign up. Now if short selling was not allowed the only thing one could do is just pass , not invest and move on. However to him it looked like a fraud , and if he could prove it well he could now make lots of money. And discovering fraud is a benefit to all especially if it is discovered early\n\nSo they investigated , they hired people to call and try to sign up but the number went no where. They then hired people to go to the headquarters to check it out, well it didn't really exist the head quarters was some public school and when their investigators they hired showed up the school listed on the address had no clue about any business or corporation at the address, it was just a public school. I cannot remember all the details but after hiring some locals to try to sign up and investigate there was no business .\n\nSo they took out a short positions because they thought the entire company was a fraud then published the findings . Then after they publish the findings it was basically confirmed , it was ; it was just a hot IPO claiming it was providing some service that it really wasn't. Others confirmed it was a fraud and the stock tanked, I believe after the Chinese government then passed regulations saying all tutoring had to be non-profit.\n\nSo what is my point? Because short selling exists now there is an incentive to  uncover fraud , like I said if short selling was not allowed why would any one spend money , time or resources doing something like this? Well if there now is a profit motive to uncover fraud well now you can at some point outsource this to the market, and the market cane move faster and quicker than the authorities can, or in this case when the authorities just don't care.""], ['That’s like saying don’t invest in us stocks because of Enron'], ['LKNCY is currently trading at $27.88, well above their IPO price.

As a result, a lot of people and companies have been able to invest a lot while taking on a lot of debt. It's not exactly like what happened in 1929 but high debt and loose investing isn't a good thing. \n\nThat has, however, led to the stock value of many companies to be over inflated, much as with tech stocks in the late 90's. \n\nWe have high inflation that is driving the value of everything down and slowing down spending, much as in the 70's. \n\nThere has been a resurgence of lending with lil attention paid to people with bad credit, mainly targeting minority communities for home loans and anyone looking for a car loan. This is similar to what we saw in '08 with a lot more over investment in real estate by hedge funds and investment groups to the point they were buying up entire subdivisions. \n\nWith the high inflation and seizing of Russian assets, we have also seen some countries advocating getting away from using the dollar. \n\nSo, what can we expect? Value of the dollar going down. Costs of everything going up. Availability of commodities going down. This will make it more costly for businesses at every level to survive. The first place businesses cut cost is typically payroll, so higher unemployment. Less people working means less people spending so everyone will be cutting their spending. \n\nLess money goes back to the companies so they will tighten their belts more. A lot of businesses will close shop. Some will get bought out or chopped up. \n\nWith costs going up and value of money going down, it's going to be harder to get loans and credit. This will make getting houses, cars, and loans of any type more difficult. It'll make it harder to get loans to start a job and companies are going to hire less. Less employment, chances are you will see more crime. With all the events of the last several years, you'll see a sharp increase of violent crime. \n\nWe could see a lot of financial instability overseas and supply chain issues that make the last few years look like a cake walk. In your typical third world country, you'll see foreign investment drop so less money and less jobs. So increases in crime, violence, insurgencies, and wars. Less food and water, when water is already a big concern for a lot of people. \n\nAlso, in such times, the typical response from some leaders has been to use it as an excuse to go to war. With other geo-political issues already in play we will probably see China try for Taiwan, Turkey going into Syria, Ethiopia and Egypt fight over water, and all sorts of God-knows what fun in the Balkans and the Middle East. That will all drive up the cost of oil and gas.\n\nOver all, we will at least, on the hopeful side, get a recession.

Microsoft,WallStreetbetsELITE,American Express works with Microsoft to reduce business travel friction (NASDAQ:MSFT),3,"[['> IT IS HARD not to be in awe of Amazon. It is one of history’s greatest companies. Jeff Bezos nurtured the firm from the humble online bookshop he founded in 1994 into a tech juggernaut, selling everything from corn syrup to cloud computing, a future trillion-dollar industry that Amazon more or less invented (see chart 1). Today it is the world’s fifth-most-valuable company, third-largest revenue generator and second-biggest private employer. Its warehouses, data centres, shops and offices cover an area almost the size of Manhattan. Consumers, competitors and politicians have been left to wonder if Amazon would take over the world. Or whether it would stop there—it is investing heavily in Kuiper, a satellite-broadband venture.\n>\n> All the superlatives notwithstanding, it is equally hard not to recognise that Amazon finds itself in something of a funk. With a downturn on the cards in America, its biggest market, shoppers are tightening their purse strings and corporate IT departments are paring back cloud spending. Amazon’s market value is down by around $1trn since its peak in mid-2021 (see chart 2), erasing all the gains of the covid-19 pandemic, when customers rushed to join its Prime subscription service and businesses were shifting their data to its cloud division, Amazon Web Services (AWS). This month Amazon announced 18,000 white-collar lay-offs, amounting to 6% of its corporate workforce. When it reports fourth-quarter earnings on February 2nd its annual revenue growth may for the first time ever come in at single digits, down from 22% in 2021. In October the company warned it might make little or no profit in the last three months of 2022.\n>\n> Amazon’s Icarus moment is not unique in big tech. All its fellow tech high-fliers have been hit as demand for their digital wares declines now that people are no longer locked down at home and postmen no longer bring pandemic-stimulus cheques from the government. But under Andy Jassy, the AWS chief who took over as CEO after Mr Bezos retired in July 2021, Amazon has expanded much more aggressively than Alphabet, Apple, Meta and Microsoft (see chart 3). This exuberance leaves the company in a tough spot as it contends with three big challenges: a sputtering retail business; decelerating cash engines of AWS and a newish advertising business; and growing competition. Can the understated Mr Jassy overcome them, and turn Amazon’s sprawling empire into a dependably profitable business?\n> \n> To understand how Amazon found itself in its current predicament, go back to just before the pandemic. The firm was already planning a big expansion of its warehouse and logistics network. The aim was to offer one-day delivery for more products to more Prime members. When national lockdowns created a boom in online shopping, Amazon doubled down. In April 2020 Mr Bezos told investors: “If you’re a shareowner in Amazon, you may want to take a seat, because we’re not thinking small.”\n> \n> Over the next two years Amazon doubled the size of its fulfilment network. Mark Mahaney of Evercore ISI, an advisory firm, calculates that Amazon added about 130m square feet (12m square metres, or nearly four Central Parks) to its global footprint in both 2020 and 2021. In those years Amazon’s cumulative capital spending reached $100bn. No company anywhere in the world invested more in that period. Last year it may have invested another $60bn, again more than anyone else. Around half that sum went on warehouses and vehicles; most of the rest on AWS data centres. Amazon also increased its payroll to 1.6m, from 800,000 in 2019.\n> \n> In the first quarter of 2022 Amazon admitted that overhiring and overbuilding were each adding $2bn to its quarterly costs, relative to 2021. Pricier fuel and higher wages meant a further $2bn a quarter. In April 2022 workers at a warehouse on Staten Island voted to unionise, and called for “more reasonable” productivity targets and more pay. If Amazon agrees to the union’s demands, the Staten Island warehouse alone could add $200m or so to annual operating costs, estimates Morgan Stanley, a bank. At the same time, retail sales slowed; in December American consumers spent 1.1% less than the month before. Amazon’s retail losses are thus piling up. Mike Morton of SVB MoffettNathanson, a research firm, estimates that when you strip out profits from ads, annual operating losses from the retail division (plus devices, entertainment and other smaller units) amount to about $30bn.\n> \n> The ad operation itself is another point of concern. In the past few years it has gone from virtually non-existent to the world’s fourth-biggest, with yearly revenues of $36bn. Its operating margins are reckoned to be around 30%, on a par with the industry’s two giants, Alphabet and Meta. But profitability may be slipping. Amazon has reportedly splurged around $1bn for the rights to stream some American-football matches, and alongside them some ads—a fortune compared with the cost of posting banners on its own website. At the same time, year-on-year growth in ad sales has slowed sharply, to 25% in the third quarter of 2022, from 53% the year before.\n> \n> Amazon’s main cash engine, AWS, is also decelerating as business customers trim their digital budgets. Soaring energy prices, especially in Europe, made it much costlier to keep the power-hungry data centres whirring. What is more, AWS is particularly vulnerable to shrivelling orders from startups, which tend to favour it over rivals such as Microsoft Azure. As their venture-capitalist backers grow stingier amid the tech rout, the young tech firms are slashing their cloud spending. In October Brian Olsavsky, Amazon’s chief financial officer, admitted that AWS’s annual sales growth had declined to around 25%, the slowest on record. The average remaining lifetime of AWS contracts also ticked down in the most recent quarter, suggesting that customers are signing fewer deals or shorter ones. Microsoft, the second-biggest cloud provider, said on January 24th that it expects sales growth at its cloud unit to decelerate by four or five percentage points this quarter.\n> \n> Another problem is stiffening competition. As covid pushed shoppers online, traditional retailers switched their focus to e-commerce. Walmart increased its last-mile-delivery capacity four-fold just since the start of 2022. Target, another legacy supermarket chain, has used its acquisition in 2017 of Shipt, an online-shopping platform, to spruce up its digital-sales channels. Between 2018 and 2021 six big conventional retailers, including Walmart and Target, increased their collective share of American e-commerce spending from 8% to 12%, according to SVB MoffettNathanson. In the same period Shopify, a Canadian firm which offers merchants tools to sell online, expanded its market share in America from 5% to 10%. It is investing heavily in its own fulfilment service, which it launched in 2019.\n> \n> Rivals are making their presence felt in Amazon’s non-retail businesses, too. AWS’s healthy first-mover lead in the cloud is being eaten away. Numbers from Synergy Research Group, a data provider, show that its global market share in the business has more or less stabilised at just over 30% in the past three years. Its two main domestic rivals, Microsoft and Alphabet, have more or less drawn level with it when taken together. In advertising, Apple has a small but growing operation and Microsoft is dipping its toe in the water, signing a deal last year to provide adverts for Netflix’s new ad-supported streaming service.\n> \n> The combination of loss-making retail, slowing profit motors and growing competition is hammering Amazon’s profitability. The firm’s overall operating margin in the third quarter of 2022 was just 2%, the lowest since 2017. In the past four quarters Amazon lost $26bn in free cashflow (the money companies generate after deducting capital investments).'], ['> Little of this can be laid directly at Mr Jassy’s door. Mr Bezos’s departure stripped the new boss of some battle-hardened lieutenants. Dave Clark, who ran the retail arm and was seen as another possible successor, left to run Flexport, a supply-chain consultancy. Charlie Bell, a talented AWS executive, jumped ship to Microsoft. Other Bezos-era stalwarts, including Jay Carney, head of public relations and policy, and Jeff Blackburn, head of media, are also moving on. Moreover, the startup-like culture of innovation Mr Bezos cultivated is hard to maintain at Amazon’s staggering size, says one longtime executive.\n> \n> As for the ambitious expansion plans, they were hatched under Mr Bezos, who remains executive chairman. The soft-spoken Mr Jassy, whom you would be forgiven for not noticing in a moderately crowded room, has said he consults his former boss about once a week. With the possible exception of concentrating the lay-offs in the Echo smart-speaker unit, in which Mr Bezos was deeply involved, it is hard to point to decisions the current CEO has made that Amazon’s founder wouldn’t have.\n> \n> With Mr Bezos preoccupied with his rocketry firm, Blue Origin, and other plutocratic pursuits, Mr Jassy looks safe in his job for the time being. But he has his work cut out. The first task is to rein in spending and boost returns. It has been a while since Amazon dialled back its capital expenditure, which it does every now and again to show shareholders just how profitable it is, notes Mark Shmulik of Bernstein, a broker.\n> \n> Now such moves may be in the offing. Last February the price of Prime membership in America rose for the first time since 2018, from $119 a year to $139. European Prime members have seen a similar increase. Fees that merchants on Amazon’s marketplace pay for fulfilment grew by more than usual in 2022, and on top of that the company levied additional surcharges for inflation and the holiday shopping season. It is trying to sublet up to 30m square feet of unneeded space and has begun offering long-term storage for vendors.\n> \n> In an effort to contain costs, Mr Jassy is binning plenty of projects. Amazon has cancelled or delayed the construction of dozens of warehouses, and closed dozens of physical shops, including all Amazon Books and 4-star outlets, which sold items that received a rating of four stars or higher online. Amazon Glow, a video-calling device, and Astro 2.0, a home robot, were also killed off. The Echo lay-offs look like an attempt by Mr Jassy to downsize a unit that was reportedly losing around $5bn a year.\n> \n> One thing Mr Jassy seems loth to do is hive off AWS into a separate company, as some investors have urged. A year ago Daniel Loeb, boss of Third Point, a hedge fund, reportedly told his clients that splitting the cloud business from the retail one could generate $1trn in shareholder value. Some big potential customers, such as Walmart, shun AWS because it is run by a retailing rival. A sale would also placate trustbusters, eager to break up what they perceive as unaccountable tech monopolies.\n> \n> A spin-off would, however, also sever potentially lucrative links between the cloud and retail arms. For instance, AWS has new artificial-intelligence (AI) tools for advertisers to target shoppers on Amazon’s e-commerce site. The line between the two businesses is blurring, says Adam Epstein, co-president of Perpetua, an ad startup. The retail unit, for its part, has spawned several AWS offerings, such as a supply-chain tool first trialled in Amazon’s grocery business. Mr Shmulik thinks AWS may start selling the clever live-streaming technology it developed to broadcast Thursday Night Football on Prime Video.\n> \n> Indeed, the future may involve weaving AWS more tightly into other parts of the empire. In time that could turn Amazon from primarily a seller of goods to consumers into a seller of increasingly AI-assisted services to both individuals and businesses. Before the pandemic, the share of Amazon’s sales coming from its main business-facing segments was 31% and high-margin services made up 37% of revenue. Today the figures are 46% and 53%, respectively. The company’s multibillion-dollar bets on Kuiper, the satellite network, and Zoox, a self-driving-car venture, hint that those shares may rise further. So do investments in health care. Last year Amazon bought One Medical, a provider of primary care, and launched Amazon Clinic, which offers virtual consultations for more than 20 ailments. On January 24th it unveiled a drug-subscription service for Prime members.\n> \n> If Mr Jassy can balance capital discipline with a few focused wagers, Amazon could return to greatness. That would be a less inspiring business tale than Mr Bezos’s pursuit of world domination. But it needn’t be less lucrative.\n> \n> Correction (January 27th 2023): This article initially said that Prime fees rose for the first time in February 2022. That was in fact the first raise since 2018.

Palantir,wallstreetbets,Palantir Technologies POP. First profitable Quarter. Going have a Nice gain tomorrow :),1164,"[['I guess stock manipulation is perfectly legal now, if you have a team of lawyers. Y’all remember that HUGE Russian hack in December 2020? Where many many governments & corporation secrets where stolen. That hack was obviously coordinated with China/Russia. And China is now giving that stolen IP to Elon to break into various sectors of the US market. There’s nothing genius about Elon, except he’s willing to betray the US. The betrayal likely started in 2018 when China awarded him the 1st “independently owned” factory in China owned by a foreigner. You think he got this special status factory because the CCP loves him? You don’t get to do business in China without being required to partner with a Chinese company OR the Chinese GOVERNMENT. Elon is not a genius, he’s a rich kid with a engineering & marketing degree. He’s been buying ads & paying influencers to market himself as a genius. Is all smoke & mirrors. The stupid purchase of Twitter was not his choice. He was ordered by Xi to own it or destroy it in the process, because China saw Twitter as a threat. \n\nAlso, Elon is not the only person that China is giving stolen IP to. There are many others. I also suspect China gave stolen IP to OpenAI, the creator of ChatGPT, which Elon & Peter Thiel are investors. There are way too many coincidences & it’s becoming clear to me that Russia/China have been using stolen IP in plain sight. But the thing is, every major government is aware of this. That’s why Russia is so dependent on China. India has been buying Russian oil at a discount too, but the jury is still out if the people of India will be a Chinese puppet & do China’s bidding. In the meantime we will all act stupid like we don’t know what’s really going on because we need China to cooperate in lowering green house emissions. But that doesn’t mean we can’t keep the best chips out of Chinas hands by coordinating with major chip makers. Europe has recently agreed to keep cutting-edge chip factory equipment out of China. China is screwed. The longer they take to make a FAIR trade deal, the worse it’s going to be for them in the long run, because the world will find new supply chains outside of China & Russia. For example the Biden administration has already partnered with northern Africa to supply Europe with natural gas. Taiwan & S Korea are making chip factories in the US to be completed in 2025. \n\nThe sad thing is, there are a large number of US voters that have fallen for crazy Qanon conspiracies spread by Russia & China. Promoting Trump as some messiah, very similar to Elon. The Republican Party knows this & instead of splitting the party are acting stupid & hoping Trump dies soon. The Dems can’t do anything about it because anything they say is always label fake news. And frankly Trump or any extreme GOP candidate getting the nomination is good news for Dems but dangerous for democracy. As we saw in the midterms, the US voters are tired of the extremist Republican Party, but the GOP doesn’t seem to care what voters want. I have no loyalty to the Dems but Biden had done a great job against China/Russia & the Republican Party has a long way to go before it can get me to support them. It’s looking like splitting the party is the only way out of this mess. A short term loss, but a HUGE win in the long run.  \n\nI welcome any comment on my analysis. Btw, Peter Thiel is a major investor in Reddit. Peter Thiel, who went on a tour promoting Bitcoin in 2022, while his firm SOLD $1.8 BILLION of their Bitcoin as he was pumping it. Bitcoin was always a Chinese weapon against the US dollar. The world is in a permanent state of cyberwar. People are just oblivious to that fact, & are too addicted to their phone to do anything about how negatively it’s affecting their mental health. The best thing one can do is probably delete the Twitter & Facebook app from your phone IMHO. I did it & have no regrets. These are many alternatives to wean off the addiction to social media. \n\nhttps://fortune.com/crypto/2023/01/18/peter-thiels-founders-fund-sold-crypto-just-before-markets-soured/'], [""Does this upet everyone?

With fiat currencies the government, in practice through a central bank like the Federal Reserve, they can produce as much fiat currency as they want as opposed to using something with a natural scarcity like gold, so to keep that system running governments institute rules to make sure that access to capital relates to resource production. With a zero interest loan there is given the rules the ability for someone to game that and effectively devalue the currency. \n1. Zero interest ensures that if there is inflation the money returned to the lender will not keep up with it (ie. a discount on the money.).\n2. There is an alternative use of that money that should on average return much better than 0%. By avoiding that they are avoiding the economic growth that goes along with that.\n3. Risk. People occasionally default and charging a good interest rate helps protect against a lender losing money if some percentage of loans turn bad.\n\nOf course, it’s a matter of degree. Your friend wanted the money to be proportionate to income. That would limit the risk and might even be superior in some special circumstances, but it increases access to capital beyond what their earning capacity already is. It is generally easier and more practical to get systems to work optimally when they don’t rely on special circumstances, though this is not always the case. Remember: Under normal economic assumptions, it is the opportunity cost that comes from a lower rate of return that effectively equates to giving someone money that would have earned more for the lender otherwise and effectively raises the recipient’s income even though based on their income they should eventually have enough to pay it off.\n\nAs for the subject of islamic banking, I think those banks avoid interest by requiring some ownership stake in the venture (I don’t know about personal loans but I’m guessing its similar).

Face value - all in you are meeting the requirements to be an arbitrage - self funding and guaranteed profit. It’s a bit more complicated \n\nFew things to consider. \n\n1) repo can trade special\n\nBasically, the repo cost of the bond you are funding can get more expensive than a sofr. This happens relatively frequently. You will have to borrow to fund the cost difference between the special and SPFR, this will add up quickly.\n\n2) Just because it’s possible an arb, doesn’t mean you can’t lose a ton of money while trying to arb\n\nThis swap spread can move in your face (let’s say to 120 bps). 30 years is a long time to absorb mark to market volatility. Even for a bank, a large 30y swap spread position will create a ton of VaR, meaning higher capital requirements, etc. Hedge funds have extremely tight VaR metrics.\n\n3) Repo haircuts\n\nWhen finding a bond with repo, the person providing the lending requires a haircut. Basically you provide a bit extra collateral on your loan (think 1 or 2 %). Functionally this means that you will need to take out a second loan to fund the haircut. This will be much more expensive than SOFR\n\n4) Leverage measures\n\nBanks are generally measured/have capital requirements on leverage, which this trade would create. Hedge funds are dependent on banks to provide them leverage, which is expensive \n\nSo all in, it’s not a true arbitrage because of repos ability to trade special, you need to borrow to fund cost of specialness/the repo haircut, and VaR constrained/market risk sensitive participants will have a lot of extra headache - which for what it’s worth is pretty much all participants putting on this trade.\n\nAlso man 30y is a long time to use up your balance sheet for something like this.'], ['[deleted]'], ['You’re ignoring spreads.\n\nYou borrow at sofr+spread (representing counterparty and credit risk).

Only 28% of shareholders voted at the AMC annual meeting in 2022. A charter amendment requires majority approval from all shareholders. And not voting has the same effect as voting against the amendment. \n* Because AMC couldn\'t issue more shares - they created APE which is technically a preferred stock which is not subject to the AMC corporate charter cap of 524,173,073 authorized shares. \n* The AMC charter has a cap of 50mm preferred shares. So to solve this cap - an APE has the same rights as 1 AMC common stock. But an APE is technically a unit equal to 1/100 of a preferred share but the equivalent economic interest as 1 share of AMC common stock.\n* One problem is that APE units are trading at a significant discount to AMC which is weird because APE and AMC should trade at similar prices because they have similar economic equivalence. \n* Ideally for AMC, if the amendment passes, AMC will have roughly 550 shares outstanding when APEs convert to AMC common. And the split will reduce the number of shares outstanding to about 145 million.\n\nBecause APE units can have different terms that do not require shareholder approval - there is a provision that reads ""In the absence of specific instructions from Holders of Receipts, the Depositary will vote the Preferred Stock represented by the AMC Preferred Equity Units evidenced by the Receipts of such Holders proportionately with votes cast pursuant to instructions received from the other Holders.""\n\nThis should give AMC a good chance to get the proposed amendment passed.

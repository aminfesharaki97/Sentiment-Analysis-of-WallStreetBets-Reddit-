      "(('comment', \"Lesson from history (from the book Superforecasting: The Art and Science of Prediction):  \\nLarry Kudlow hosted a business talk show on CNBC and is a widely published pundit, but he got his start as an economist in the Reagan administration and later worked with Art Laffer, the economist whose theories were the cornerstone of Ronald Reagan’s economic policies. Kudlow’s one Big Idea is supply-side economics. When President George W. Bush followed the supply-side prescription by enacting substantial tax cuts, Kudlow was certain an economic boom of equal magnitude would follow. He dubbed it “the Bush boom.” Reality fell short: growth and job creation were positive but somewhat disappointing relative to the long-term average and particularly in comparison to that of the Clinton era, which began with a substantial tax hike. But Kudlow stuck to his guns and insisted, year after year, that the “Bush boom” was happening as forecast, even if commentators hadn’t noticed. He called it “the biggest story never told.” In December 2007, months after the first rumblings of the financial crisis had been felt, the economy looked shaky, and many observers worried a recession was coming, or had even arrived, Kudlow was optimistic. “There is no recession,” he wrote. “In fact, we are about to enter the seventh consecutive year of the Bush boom.”  \\nThe National Bureau of Economic Research later designated December 2007 as the official start of the Great Recession of 2007–9. As the months passed, the economy weakened and worries grew, but Kudlow did not budge. There is no recession and there will be no recession, he insisted. When the White House said the same in April 2008, Kudlow wrote, “President George W. Bush may turn out to be the top economic forecaster in the country.” Through the spring and into summer, the economy worsened but Kudlow denied it. “We are in a mental recession, not an actual recession,” he wrote, a theme he kept repeating until September 15, when Lehman Brothers filed for bankruptcy, Wall Street was thrown into chaos, the global financial system froze, and people the world over felt like passengers in a plunging jet, eyes wide, fingers digging into armrests.  \\nHow could Kudlow be so consistently wrong? Like all of us, hedgehog forecasters first see things from the tip-of-your-nose perspective. That’s natural enough. But the hedgehog also “knows one big thing,” the Big Idea he uses over and over when trying to figure out what will happen next. Think of that Big Idea like a pair of glasses that the hedgehog never takes off. The hedgehog sees everything through those glasses. And they aren’t ordinary glasses. They’re green-tinted glasses—like the glasses that visitors to the Emerald City were required to wear in L. Frank Baum’s The Wonderful Wizard of Oz. Now, wearing green-tinted glasses may sometimes be helpful, in that they accentuate something real that might otherwise be overlooked. Maybe there is just a trace of green in a tablecloth that a naked eye might miss, or a subtle shade of green in running water. But far more often, green-tinted glasses distort reality. Everywhere you look, you see green, whether it’s there or not. And very often, it’s not. The Emerald City wasn't even emerald in the fable. People only thought it was because they were forced to wear green-tinted glasses! So the hedgehog’s one Big Idea doesn’t improve his foresight. It distorts it. And more information doesn’t help because it’s all seen through the same tinted glasses. It may increase the hedgehog’s confidence, but not his accuracy. That’s a bad combination. The predictable result? When hedgehogs in the EPJ research made forecasts on the subjects they knew the most about—their own specialties—their accuracy declined. The American economy is Larry Kudlow’s beat, but in 2008, when it was increasingly obvious that it was in trouble, he didn’t see what others did. He couldn’t. Everything looked green to him.  \\nNot that being wrong hurt Kudlow’s career. In January 2009, with the American economy in a crisis worse than any since the Great Depression, Kudlow’s new show, The Kudlow Report, premiered on CNBC. That too is consistent with the EPJ data, which revealed an inverse correlation between fame and accuracy: the more famous an expert was, the less accurate he was. That’s not because editors, producers, and the public go looking for bad forecasters. They go looking for hedgehogs, who just happen to be bad forecasters. Animated by a Big Idea, hedgehogs tell tight, simple, clear stories that grab and hold audiences. As anyone who has done media training knows, the first rule is “keep it simple, stupid.” Better still, hedgehogs are confident. With their one-perspective analysis, hedgehogs can pile up reasons why they are right—“furthermore,” “moreover”—without considering other perspectives and the pesky doubts and caveats they raise. And so, as EPJ showed, hedgehogs are likelier to say something definitely will or won’t happen. For many audiences, that’s satisfying. People tend to find uncertainty disturbing and “maybe” underscores uncertainty with a bright red crayon. The simplicity and confidence of the hedgehog impairs foresight, but it calms nerves—which is good for the careers of hedgehogs.  \\nFoxes don’t fare so well in the media. They’re less confident, less likely to say something is “certain” or “impossible,” and are likelier to settle on shades of “maybe.” And their stories are complex, full of “howevers” and “on the other hands,” because they look at problems one way, then another, and another. This aggregation of many perspectives is bad TV. But it’s good forecasting. Indeed, it’s essential.\"), ('comment_score', 2)) 1\n",

As a result, a lot of people and companies have been able to invest a lot while taking on a lot of debt. It's not exactly like what happened in 1929 but high debt and loose investing isn't a good thing. \\n\\nThat has, however, led to the stock value of many companies to be over inflated, much as with tech stocks in the late 90's. \\n\\nWe have high inflation that is driving the value of everything down and slowing down spending, much as in the 70's. \\n\\nThere has been a resurgence of lending with lil attention paid to people with bad credit, mainly targeting minority communities for home loans and anyone looking for a car loan. This is similar to what we saw in '08 with a lot more over investment in real estate by hedge funds and investment groups to the point they were buying up entire subdivisions. \\n\\nWith the high inflation and seizing of Russian assets, we have also seen some countries advocating getting away from using the dollar. \\n\\nSo, what can we expect? Value of the dollar going down. Costs of everything going up. Availability of commodities going down. This will make it more costly for businesses at every level to survive. The first place businesses cut cost is typically payroll, so higher unemployment. Less people working means less people spending so everyone will be cutting their spending. \\n\\nLess money goes back to the companies so they will tighten their belts more. A lot of businesses will close shop. Some will get bought out or chopped up. \\n\\nWith costs going up and value of money going down, it's going to be harder to get loans and credit. This will make getting houses, cars, and loans of any type more difficult. It'll make it harder to get loans to start a job and companies are going to hire less. Less employment, chances are you will see more crime. With all the events of the last several years, you'll see a sharp increase of violent crime. \\n\\nWe could see a lot of financial instability overseas and supply chain issues that make the last few years look like a cake walk. In your typical third world country, you'll see foreign investment drop so less money and less jobs. So increases in crime, violence, insurgencies, and wars. Less food and water, when water is already a big concern for a lot of people. \\n\\nAlso, in such times, the typical response from some leaders has been to use it as an excuse to go to war. With other geo-political issues already in play we will probably see China try for Taiwan, Turkey going into Syria, Ethiopia and Egypt fight over water, and all sorts of God-knows what fun in the Balkans and the Middle East. That will all drive up the cost of oil and gas.\\n\\nOver all, we will at least, on the hopeful side, get a recession. It will bring down inflation, people will save money more, and we can get some stocks on sale. But the dominoes are set up for it to be really bad.

If that doesn\\'t suit you and you want thousands of parts in your vehicle, go for it. Have fun paying to get it fixed eventually down the line.\\n\\n\"It\\'s not safe to drive.\"\\n\\nLiterally one of the safest vehicles you CAN drive because there is no engine, the battery sits on the bottom meaning you have a low center of gravity, and the steel framing of the vehicle absorbs a crap ton of the damage during a crash. You may have heard the story of someone who intentionally drove their Tesla down a cliff to commit suicide with his family inside and they survived with quite minimal injuries. In fact, Tesla has probably the safest vehicle scores tested in their Model S, Y, and E.\\n\\n\"Their interior is cheap. That\\'s how they are able to make high margins.\"\\n\\nThe interior isn\\'t luxury but that\\'s not what you\\'re buying a Tesla for. You\\'re buying it for the technology they offer, supercharging network, more reliable EV, and the fact that other EV makers just aren\\'t capable of producing a similar EV product. When you can play Steam games, have OTA updates to improve the cameras of your vehicle without replacing them, increase the efficiency of vehicle range, etc., let me know. No one comes close to Tesla in software and tech capabilities. If the tech isn\\'t for you, don\\'t buy a Tesla. It\\'s really that simple. You\\'re wasting your money.\\n\\nThe reason Tesla\\'s margins are higher has to do with lower battery costs, lack of a dealership network, way more efficient manufacturing processes, and they are a master at saving money because they worked at the company since the inception and know every part that isn\\'t required. Current legacy automakers leadership took over when those car companies have been constructing vehicles for nearly a century. They\\'re more concerned with the financials than the engineering within the company which is why they allowed some random guy who owned PayPal to come in and dominate the EV industry despite having no experience in vehicles. Musk was in Tesla before they even had a vehicle out so they had to start from point A and thus, everything was designed for maximum efficiency and lower cost.\\n\\nAgain, if the tech isn\\'t for you, please do NOT buy a Tesla.

Where many many governments & corporation secrets where stolen. That hack was obviously coordinated with China/Russia. And China is now giving that stolen IP to Elon to break into various sectors of the US market. There’s nothing genius about Elon, except he’s willing to betray the US. The betrayal likely started in 2018 when China awarded him the 1st “independently owned” factory in China owned by a foreigner. You think he got this special status factory because the CCP loves him? You don’t get to do business in China without being required to partner with a Chinese company OR the Chinese GOVERNMENT. Elon is not a genius, he’s a rich kid with a engineering & marketing degree. He’s been buying ads & paying influencers to market himself as a genius. Is all smoke & mirrors. The stupid purchase of Twitter was not his choice. He was ordered by Xi to own it or destroy it in the process, because China saw Twitter as a threat. \\n\\nAlso, Elon is not the only person that China is giving stolen IP to. There are many others. I also suspect China gave stolen IP to OpenAI, the creator of ChatGPT, which Elon & Peter Thiel are investors. There are way too many coincidences & it’s becoming clear to me that Russia/China have been using stolen IP in plain sight. But the thing is, every major government is aware of this. That’s why Russia is so dependent on China. India has been buying Russian oil at a discount too, but the jury is still out if the people of India will be a Chinese puppet & do China’s bidding. In the meantime we will all act stupid like we don’t know what’s really going on because we need China to cooperate in lowering green house emissions. But that doesn’t mean we can’t keep the best chips out of Chinas hands by coordinating with major chip makers. Europe has recently agreed to keep cutting-edge chip factory equipment out of China. China is screwed. The longer they take to make a FAIR trade deal, the worse it’s going to be for them in the long run, because the world will find new supply chains outside of China & Russia. For example the Biden administration has already partnered with northern Africa to supply Europe with natural gas. Taiwan & S Korea are making chip factories in the US to be completed in 2025. \\n\\nThe sad thing is, there are a large number of US voters that have fallen for crazy Qanon conspiracies spread by Russia & China. Promoting Trump as some messiah, very similar to Elon. The Republican Party knows this & instead of splitting the party are acting stupid & hoping Trump dies soon. The Dems can’t do anything about it because anything they say is always label fake news. And frankly Trump or any extreme GOP candidate getting the nomination is good news for Dems but dangerous for democracy. As we saw in the midterms, the US voters are tired of the extremist Republican Party, but the GOP doesn’t seem to care what voters want. I have no loyalty to the Dems but Biden had done a great job against China/Russia & the Republican Party has a long way to go before it can get me to support them. It’s looking like splitting the party is the only way out of this mess. A short term loss, but a HUGE win in the long run.  \\n\\nI welcome any comment on my analysis. Btw, Peter Thiel is a major investor in Reddit. Peter Thiel, who went on a tour promoting Bitcoin in 2022, while his firm SOLD $1.8 BILLION of their Bitcoin as he was pumping it. Bitcoin was always a Chinese weapon against the US dollar. The world is in a permanent state of cyberwar. People are just oblivious to that fact, & are too addicted to their phone to do anything about how negatively it’s affecting their mental health. The best thing one can do is probably delete the Twitter & Facebook app from your phone IMHO. I did it & have no regrets.

With fiat currencies the government, in practice through a central bank like the Federal Reserve, they can produce as much fiat currency as they want as opposed to using something with a natural scarcity like gold, so to keep that system running governments institute rules to make sure that access to capital relates to resource production. With a zero interest loan there is given the rules the ability for someone to game that and effectively devalue the currency. \\n1. Zero interest ensures that if there is inflation the money returned to the lender will not keep up with it (ie. a discount on the money.).\\n2. There is an alternative use of that money that should on average return much better than 0%. By avoiding that they are avoiding the economic growth that goes along with that.\\n3. Risk. People occasionally default and charging a good interest rate helps protect against a lender losing money if some percentage of loans turn bad.\\n\\nOf course, it’s a matter of degree. Your friend wanted the money to be proportionate to income. That would limit the risk and might even be superior in some special circumstances, but it increases access to capital beyond what their earning capacity already is. It is generally easier and more practical to get systems to work optimally when they don’t rely on special circumstances, though this is not always the case. Remember: Under normal economic assumptions, it is the opportunity cost that comes from a lower rate of return that effectively equates to giving someone money that would have earned more for the lender otherwise and effectively raises the recipient’s income even though based on their income they should eventually have enough to pay it off.\\n\\nAs for the subject of islamic banking, I think those banks avoid interest by requiring some ownership stake in the venture (I don’t know about personal loans but I’m guessing its similar).

Only 28% of shareholders voted at the AMC annual meeting in 2022. A charter amendment requires majority approval from all shareholders. And not voting has the same effect as voting against the amendment. \\n* Because AMC couldn\\'t issue more shares - they created APE which is technically a preferred stock which is not subject to the AMC corporate charter cap of 524,173,073 authorized shares. \\n* The AMC charter has a cap of 50mm preferred shares. So to solve this cap - an APE has the same rights as 1 AMC common stock. But an APE is technically a unit equal to 1/100 of a preferred share but the equivalent economic interest as 1 share of AMC common stock.\\n* One problem is that APE units are trading at a significant discount to AMC which is weird because APE and AMC should trade at similar prices because they have similar economic equivalence. \\n* Ideally for AMC, if the amendment passes, AMC will have roughly 550 shares outstanding when APEs convert to AMC common. And the split will reduce the number of shares outstanding to about 145 million.\\n\\nBecause APE units can have different terms that do not require shareholder approval - there is a provision that reads \"In the absence of specific instructions from Holders of Receipts, the Depositary will vote the Preferred Stock represented by the AMC Preferred Equity Units evidenced by the Receipts of such Holders proportionately with votes cast pursuant to instructions received from the other Holders.\"\\n\\nThis should give AMC a good chance to get the proposed amendment passed.

Was up something like 500% in a few weeks. The stock was some sort of Chinese tutoring business what is big in china. Basically to get into top highs schools and colleges you have to earn top grades just to get a chance so lots of wealthy Chinese people will spend thousands and thousand on tutors to make sure their kids get placed in top schools so it seemed a good business model on the surface\\n\\nOnce the guy researched the stock a lot of stuff was not adding up, he knew basic Mandarin but not well, he saw the website but the first red flag was there was really no way to actually sign up. Now if short selling was not allowed the only thing one could do is just pass , not invest and move on. However to him it looked like a fraud , and if he could prove it well he could now make lots of money. And discovering fraud is a benefit to all especially if it is discovered early\\n\\nSo they investigated , they hired people to call and try to sign up but the number went no where. They then hired people to go to the headquarters to check it out, well it didn't really exist the head quarters was some public school and when their investigators they hired showed up the school listed on the address had no clue about any business or corporation at the address, it was just a public school. I cannot remember all the details but after hiring some locals to try to sign up and investigate there was no business .\\n\\nSo they took out a short positions because they thought the entire company was a fraud then published the findings . Then after they publish the findings it was basically confirmed , it was ; it was just a hot IPO claiming it was providing some service that it really wasn't. Others confirmed it was a fraud and the stock tanked, I believe after the Chinese government then passed regulations saying all tutoring had to be non-profit.\\n\\nSo what is my point? Because short selling exists now there is an incentive to  uncover fraud , like I said if short selling was not allowed why would any one spend money , time or resources doing something like this?

I think with Levelfields it is a difficult thing.\\n\\nI have subscribed to their tier 1 subscription. The system does indeed seem to do what it is supposed to. It seems to scrape current stock market news and (probably) classify it via AI into various event categories, which then predict a one probability of future price action based on old price + event data.\\n\\nThis is also demonstrably true. With my subscription I started to execute my trades only strictly according to their system and unfortunately lost a lot of money because the system has a big quirk:\\n\\nEvent Alerts only come in two to three times a day and usually at set times. A lot of them come at the stock markets closing time. Very recent example:\\n\\nJust now, at 13:30 (Amsterdam timezone) an email alert reached me that a large company wants to do a share buyback, which Levelfields considers a bullish signal. The stock is also up about 2.7% in a short time. But that was an hour ago. And that\\'s the way it is with almost all Levelfields signals, unfortunately. The signals do(t) indeed work, but by the time Levelfields posts them, the train has long since left the station. So the system as a whole doesn\\'t seem to work.\\n\\nDo I feel cheated? Absolutely and I think what Levelfields is doing is a big cheek!\\n\\nDo I think it is a scam? Absolutely not, because I think the problem lies elsewhere, let me explain:\\n\\nI researched everything I found about Levelfields before I signed up (there isn\\'t all that much and that\\'s what I\\'m getting at). Especially the Reddit posts that exist about it were enlightening for me. u/levelfieldsai and the few posts made under the account give me the following impression:\\n\\n\\\\- There is indeed an ambitious and probably hard working team behind the company. I think so because the passionate way u/levelfieldsai writes sounds authentic.\\n\\n\\\\- In their advertisement on Reddit, they are criticized and take a stand on it. It\\'s clear from this that they don\\'t really have a functioning marketing yet. This also explains the little info that can be found about the company. Conclusion: Maybe it\\'s a small team which is heavily utilized, so +1 for the previous point.\\n\\n\\\\- Independently from Reddit, I found a blog post on a website for young entrepreneurs (I think the site is called Indiehackers or something like that) where the CEO of Levelfields talks about his career with the company. This article does not have any marketing effect and the target audience here are other young entrepreneurs, the article rather corresponds to the genre \"exchange of experiences\" and is also written in corresponding complexity. Another point for credibility.\\n\\n\\\\- The time and frequency in which the alerts arrive, which is also the critical sticking point here, is at the same intervals with a few exceptions. This leads me to believe that the email service that Levelfields use is the problem. Either the scheduling is just grotty badly timed or the service is overloaded beyond measure.\\n\\nI just think Levelfields have taken on too much and have too little capacity to get these problems under control. And no, to emphazise this again: I don\\'t want to make anything more attractive like it is, and I have no sympathy for it at all as  I feel scammed. I was sold a product that only half works. And half a function is still NO function in the end. Levelfields got my money for a product they can\\'t deliver.\\n\\nThe idea is great, and the problem doesn\\'t strike me as something that can\\'t be fixed. If you could just get a handle on this thing, these guys wouldn\\'t have to worry about marketing at all, because people would be beating down their doors on their own. I don\\'t know why you can\\'t recognize this as a company, when you actually want to earn money with your idea as your MAIN GOAL.\\n\\nEy, boy you have a problem and here is the neon sign pointing with thick, red arrows to your problem, get it under control!...

But as a marketer I know you sometimes have to slam people over the head with a freakin iron pot to get them to look \\n\\n  \\nI emailed the levelfields support people with some questions and it was actually their helpdesk that convinced me to try it. I asked the same question about the lag time between the event and the alerts and they told me 90% were between 20-40mins (which I have found to be accurate). \\n\\n  \\nI expected I’d get the info immediately so I asked if that was fast enough to beat the market. they said sometimes the hedge funds find the events quickly pre-market but they sell just as fast, which leaves a better entry point. They also showed me this on a graph which was really convincing and that actually became part of my trading strategy.\\n\\n  \\nFor some events, there’s an early and steep price move but there are many others where the price moves for the whole day and days later. \\n\\n  \\nI work full-time so the alerts are a big time saver and picks up some crazy niche industries you never knew existed. I just wish they had a mobile app that automatically linked to my brokerage account.  \\n\\n\\nI think they actually screwed up their messaging because as a swing trader, I’ve found the biggest returns playing the events longer term and on the reverse - shorting the selloff after a big event. It’s got a big database of price movements. \\n\\n  \\nIf you’re a newbie trader you probably won’t appreciate it as much but if you’re a metrics geek like me, it’s just a treasure of different trade possibilities (day, long, short, straddles, strangles, covered calls, put selling, etc). Had they marketed this way, I would’ve been less weary.   \\n\\n\\nAll in all, I recommend it with the note that if you don’t know what a P/E ratio is or don’t have the stomach for learning through some volatility, you’re better off sticking to ETFs and not trading'), ('comment_score', 5)) 1\n",

They come quickly and often. You can\\'t trade them all, there are like 280 per month.  The vast majority - above 80% - arrive within 30-40minutes of the event. \\n\\nIf you\\'re trying to trade pre-market, you\\'ll see a ton of volatility but there are plenty of entry points and trading patterns afterhours and intraday. \\n\\n**Here were a few from today for example:**\\n\\n1) Dupont (bullish)\\n\\nAlert sent premarket today and on Nov 13, 2022\\n\\nOpen price: 74.92\\n\\nClosing price: 77.79\\n\\n2) BP (bullish)\\n\\nAlert sent premarket at 420am ET (hehe)\\n\\nOpen price: 36.24\\n\\nClosing price: 37.75 and yesterday\\'s close was 35.00\\n\\n3) SKWS (bullish)\\n\\nAlert sent yesterday at 435pm\\n\\nOpening price today: 114.85\\n\\nClosing price today: 122.97\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nAs you can see, there\\'s ample time to take advantage of the alerts. \\n\\nThere can be quick action in the afterhours trading. But there is always a way to enter the trade. You can wait for the reversal. You can also short it. But you can\\'t do any of that unless you know about the event.\\n\\nSaying that the trade is gone after a few minutes is simply not true. It\\'s not a rocket ship - stocks don\\'t go up in a straight line too often and if they do they always pullback when sellers take gains. \\n\\nI want our alerts out instantly, but there are many processes that have to run to clean the data, take noise out of the data, match prices, reduce duplicates and false positives, etc. That process can take about 20-30 minutes as we\\'re indexing tons of data at a time. \\n\\nIf Amazon and MSFT want to lend us a few dozen datacenters we can given you the extra 30mins you want but in my view, it\\'s working quite well as is and you really shouldn\\'t stress about trading afterhours when there is plenty of price action short and long term.\\n\\nI would also like to point out that these events are NOT JUST 1D trades. You can use them to locate companies you\\'ve never heard of. I LOVE using it for this and am surprised every single day about the diversity of companies out there. Like packaging companies.

Since Apple, Amazon, Google, and Microsoft make up about 20% of the QQQ, I do think the Q is a good investment (or even SPY) once the 4Q earnings for those four companies come out and I expect the share prices to drop.  I\\'d still like to see the P/E for both at 15 though.\\n\\nWith all of these growth companies (and you can argue that Disney might not be one but they have been recently valued as one IMHO) they usually work off a multiple of sales with Amazon being historically 2 times sales.  However, I believe there has been a recent shift to valuation and profitability.\\n\\nIndividually here is how I look at each one:\\n\\nNetflix - King of streaming but content creation is killing them financially and their earnings will be interesting because if it\\'s bad then I expect Disney\\'s price to suffer by association.\\n\\nDisney - Great company with every division except for streaming doing very well.  If that division can be right sized then this is a great opportunity when P/E comes down.  Headwinds might be inflation pressure with people maybe pushing out their vacations or not going as often so that might impact revenues.  Personally I try to go to the parks at least once a year and always have a good time.  Thankfully they are a large conglomerate so if parks revenues take a hit they have other divisions that can make up the difference.\\n\\nAmazon - I stopped out of this last year after going down 20% from the high.

If they just ran with the advertising model on top of the content, this company would continue to be a cash cow and highly profitable.  I do not agree with Z\\'s metaverse and based on that I avoid this stock.

Do you think that AI art is only a threat to artists (by artists I mean the people who draw, paint, 3d model or/and render the images) or it\\'s both a threat to artists and Art directors like you too?\\n3. Do you think that traditional art (physical painting with pigments in a canvas or graphite drawings etc.) or digital art with wacom tablet in the future will be less valuable, more valuable or equal valuable? I mean, AI art maybe (I don\\'t know) will be more impressive to see compared to traditional art, but traditional art will be more unique and require more effort and skills and also will be more \"human\".\\n\\nSorry if these questions are very personal.

It seems like their phone tech is kind of plateauing, and competitors seem to be putting out really good phones with even better cameras. 80% of my desire for a new phone comes from an updated camera. If Apple finally catches up with the competition and includes folded optics, or a ‘periscope’ lens design to actually include an optical zoom lens, it will likely only be implemented in the largest ‘pro’ model. Which puts it another year out of reach for me. They tend to do very incremental updates to introduce new features, so it will likely only fit in the largest model to start with (which is all speculation, of course).\\n\\nGranted, these machines are **incredible** and the fact that I can have a perfectly functional 5 year old phone and pay less than $100 for a brand new battery that lasts all day, given that I literally waste 8 hours or so of my life away, every day on my phone (yikes), this little machine is a modern miracle. \\n\\nMy question is, where do they go from here? \\n\\nWell, for starters, then can make their phones more affordable and cut their margins a bit. Last I heard, they have some kind of 3x markup on these phones. That could both hurt investor sentiment, but also boost sales. So I’m not sure if they believe they have found a sweet spot there or not. During a recessionary phase in the market, it may be wise to cut pricing. More phones sales will equal more app purchasing, so it would still be beneficial in the long run. \\n\\nAnother big deal could be to introduce a slightly thicker camera-centric phone. That would allow for a larger battery and an actual decent sized sensor and folded optics zoom lens.\\n\\nOtoh, their MacBook line looks amazing since they bounced from using Intel. I’m probably going to pick up a new MBP or MBA this year, and definitely not going to buy a base model. The efficiency of those machines look amazing and battery charge lasts forever, so it is with great pleasure that I’ll be upgrading soon. These machines have been a joy to use ever since they introduced the uni-body design in 2008 or so.

It takes time for this cycle to play out however, that's why I think inflation is bad short term but creates a floor long term.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nThe real reason it should be bad for stocks at the moment is simply because stocks compete with fixed income assets.

Not only generative ais can increase productivity but it can also save companies alot of money..i will give you an example..there are currently about 16000 starbucks in us..lets say out of those 16000 starbucks, 10000 have drive throughs..for each one of those drive throughs you need one person whose main job is to take drive through orders and interact with the customers..lets say that person makes $30k per year so starbucks is spending  $300 million every year to keep their drive throughs running…you can completely replace that person with a generative ai..to replace that person you will need a ai that can translate human speech into text, a language model that can understand that text and give back a human like text answer and a ai system that can translate that text response into human speech and interact with the costumer..currently we have all of those technologies especially after recent developments in ai field..ofcourse somebody will eventually figure out a simple speech to speech ai which will remove all those different layers in the process..the initial implementation of such a system might cost some money but after its deployed they only have to maintan it which will be a heck lot cheaper than 300 million every year..Starbucks will save alot of money by implementing such an ai and we are not even accounting for things like health insurance,sick days, pay increases etc. This is only one example of how current ai systems can be used..ai is also already being used by most big tech companies for alot of back end stuff..targeted advertising uses ai, when you ask google search a very specific question like “what is the capital of japan”?, it will generate a answer for you at the top which uses ai..google has already been integrating ai in its search..most of it was on the backend but now with chatgpt, it has become more consumer facing…if you think about all the applications ai can be used for, it will have a much bigger impact on human productivity and living standards than the industrial revolution did imo.'), ('comment_score', 4)) 1\n",

But by the end of those 2-4 years, I’d suspect they’ll be up.\\n\\nI know this forum is for gamblers. But if you’re the more reserved and serious type, just look at how Amazon and Google have had linear growth over the past 10 years (discounting the covid bump, which is almost entirely gone now). \\n\\nThat’s a 5-fold increase over those 10 years. \\n\\nOf course there’s no guarantee that they’ll perform that same way again, but I’d bet that others are betting on them, which in turn makes the probability of success on those bets go up. \\n\\nSo if you had a good savings, like $100,00, that could probably be $500,000 in those 10 years (and you don’t pay short-term taxes either). \\n\\nIf you have $200,000 in savings, then you’re looking at $1,000,000 if all goes well. \\n\\nSo a house that usually takes 30 years to pay off, and usually costs over 2x the listing price due to interest (yes, interest really does double the amount you pay on a house) can be paid off in 10 years. \\n\\nMeanwhile, during those 10 years, just keep working.  If you can score a job that pays close to $100,000 (they’re easier to get these days than they were in 1980) then you’ll gross another $1,000,000 (of which you will keep 65% due to taxes).  You can comfortably live off that, and maybe even save a nice chunk.  \\n\\nHeck, if you do have such a job and you can save, then maybe a good bet is to save for 5 years while living in an apartment (or a van, if you’re extremely young) and then you can have money for a big down payment on a house. This would be separate of your stock portfolio. Then for those next 5 years, you can throw down as much as you can into your mortgage to kill the interest (or else interest will kill you).  And by the end of those 5 years in a house, your portfolio will be 10 years old and you hopefully have that $500k-$1M.  Boom, your house is paid and you still have a damn good paying job. \\n\\nNow you can afford to buy a second house and rent it out for passive income.

Yes they have been doing some AI, but it's not very good and it would also jeopardize their core business. And yes, Google is mainly Google Search and advertisement. Bing AI cuts right through that like a hot knife through butter. \\n\\nMicrosoft can do that because for them it's a huge business opportunity. Nadella has openly said so. They can sit in the launch chair and do their thing without much risk.  Google however would need to find how to monetize AI search to replace their search and ad revenue. So they don't have an incentive to go too quickly. You can see that in their presentation, where they announced their Bard thing but it wasn't even their focus, just a small part of how good their existing portfolio is. Do you know how that sounds? Like Kodak showing a little digital camera but not making it very good, because that jeopardizes their film business. \\n\\nAnd is Google actually good at innovating and more importantly executing their innovations? I would say no - most Google ventures start off promising and are then only followed up half assed and eventually scrapped. Chromebooks could have been awesome. I was hooked on the possibility of Android and lightweight Chrome Os. But its half-assed and not very well integrated. Market share is still dissmal. Pixel phones - also half assed. Google Glass - complete failure. Google self driving cars - no news while even Mercedes seems to be further. Google fi internet - a joke. Every time they mention Gmail and Google maps as examples.

This is a good idea if your investment thesis has changed and you think Tesla is going to the moon and you want to take the loss on the options now to keep your shares long-term.\\n2. Let the options expire ITM tomorrow. You will be assigned on the calls, and have to sell your 200 Tesla shares at $197.5, collecting $39,500. Even though that's below the going market price for TSLA, it's above what you paid for the shares, so you will make a total profit, cradle to grave, on your TSLA shares of $39,500 - $32,000 + (whatever credit you received for selling the two options) = min. $7,500. But your shares of TSLA will be gone. This is a good idea if you want to bank some cash immediately and don't want to invest in TSLA for the long term.\\n\\nEdit: My advice is since you clearly don't know what the hell you're doing, just do nothing and let the options expire tomorrow evening.

This means that if the stock price goes above the call price that you sold your calls at, in your case if the stock goes above 197, by the expiration date then you HAVE to sell your 200 shares at the price of 197 which is where you sold your calls at. So you bought 200 shares at 165 and you have to sell them at 197. You make profit however it’s capped at a maximum of 197 which is where you sold your covered calls. You “covered” your shares by selling calls at 197. Even though the stock is above 197 you only get the profit from the difference from your buy point (167) and your sell point (197).  \\n\\nYou still make profit and you collected the premium from selling the calls initially. The only thing you missed out on is additional profit. If you didn’t sell the calls you wouldn’t be capped at 197. However you couldn’t predict what the price would be. Selling the covered calls is a tool to reduce risk. If the price didn’t jump you would’ve collected the premium and kept the shares. But you covered your shares. And you gained a profit of 200 shares x (197 (your covered call strike price) -  165 (your initial buy point) ).

Stop thinking of AI as a replacement for a human actor and instead think of it as an augment. No major players are trying to replace humans yet for all the points that you mentioned, all of them are interested in augmenting existing human use cases to make them faster and more productive. Students still need to learn how to properly write an essay to take full advantage of the tool, its not the AIs job to get it right for them, just to make things go by faster. And for professionals this is a non-issue as they already know what \"correct\" looks like. The tool is just giving them a shortcut to what they would likely have already written, or something close to it.\\n2. This isn\\'t hardware, any issues with an auto complete service can be fixed in days (if not less), and we live in world where you have broad adoption of services and can get feedback fairly quickly (even without the user giving you explicate feedback). Any major issues with models are likely to get caught and fixed before they have a widespread impact.\\n3. You\\'re still assuming that the AI model needs to do the full cycle. I don\\'t need the autocomplete to do refinement or pruning, I just need it to be reasonably good at the inference part. If its right only half the time that\\'s still a huge improvement, and when its wrong I can either correct it by hand, not use the output, or \"reroll\" the suggestion to get something that might be closer to what I want. \\n4. We already have solutions like this for software development that work basically as I described. [GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot) being the main example. I use this daily and it saves a ton of time when it gets it right, completing entire functions, or writing my docs for me. And when it doesn\\'t I just ignore it and its no skin off my back.\\n\\nTLDR is basically assume a competent human is part of the loop at all times, these tools can make someone who already knows what they are doing get more work done in less time. You don\\'t need full AI to get a benefit now.'), ('comment_score', 6)) 1\n",

Credit...Gabby Jones for The New York Times\\n\\nMatthew GoldsteinEmily Flitter\\nBy Matthew Goldstein and Emily Flitter\\nJan. 4, 2023\\n\\nCoinbase, a publicly traded cryptocurrency trading exchange based in the United States, agreed to pay a $50 million fine after financial regulators found that it let customers open accounts without conducting sufficient background checks, in violation of anti-money-laundering laws.\\n\\nThe settlement with the New York State Department of Financial Services, announced Wednesday, will also require Coinbase to invest $50 million to bolster its compliance program, which is supposed to prevent drug traffickers, sellers of child pornography and other potential lawbreakers from opening accounts with the exchange.\\n\\nIt’s the latest hit to the once-highflying global cryptocurrency trading business. Several cryptocurrency firms have filed for bankruptcy over the past year — most notably FTX, which was the world’s second-largest crypto exchange before it collapsed in November. Sam Bankman-Fried, the founder, and other top FTX executives now face federal criminal charges.\\n\\nThe compliance problems at Coinbase were first detected during a routine examination in 2020 after the exchange secured a license to operate in New York in 2017, regulators said. They found problems with the exchange’s anti-money-laundering controls going as far back as 2018.\\nCoinbase initially agreed to hire an independent consultant to help overhaul its day-to-day operations so that they met requirements set by anti-money-laundering laws to know the identities of customers and monitor their behavior for suspicious activity.\\n\\nBut that did not fix the company’s problems, and regulators opened a formal investigation in 2021. The exchange had fallen behind on two key operations: digging deeper into the backgrounds of customers whose identities seemed murky at first glance and following up on the suspicious-activity alerts that its internal monitoring system generated.\\n\\nBy late 2021, Coinbase had a backlog of more than 100,000 alerts about potential suspicious customer transactions that were not being properly examined, according to the Department of Financial Services. Regulators also found that Coinbase performed only the most rudimentary “know your customer” checks on people before letting them open accounts. The exchange treated customer background checks as a “simple check-the-box exercise,” they said.\\n\\nIn one instance, Coinbase unwittingly helped a digital thief steal $150 million from an unnamed company by claiming to be an employee of that company when opening a Coinbase account.\\n\\nThe company’s procedures in vetting the backgrounds of customers were so inadequate that early last year, regulators ordered Coinbase to hire an outside monitor — separate from the independent consultant the firm had previously agreed to hire — to oversee its compliance, even as the formal investigation was underway.\\n“We found failures that really warranted putting in place an independent monitor rather than wait for a settlement,” Adrienne A. Harris, New York State’s superintendent of financial services, said in an interview. “We have been very outspoken about illicit financing concerns in the space. It is why our framework holds crypto companies to the same standard as for banks.”\\n\\n“Coinbase remains committed to being a leader and role model in the crypto space, and this means partnering with regulators when it comes to compliance and other areas,” the company’s chief legal officer, Paul Grewal, wrote in a blog post on its website on Wednesday.\\n\\nShares of Coinbase rose 12 percent on Wednesday, closing at nearly $38.\\n\\nThe settlement, which says Coinbase is still moving too slowly in its efforts to review its older accounts for suspicious features, will require the exchange to work with the monitor for at least another year as it puts in place systems to improve its compliance operation. New York regulators did not identify the monitor.\\n\\nMs. Harris said Coinbase’s compliance department had failed to keep up with the exchange’s rapid growth. Founded in San Francisco in 2012, Coinbase has a market capitalization of more than $7.6 billion and is the largest crypto trading platform based in the United States, with 100 million users worldwide. Most of its peers are based in jurisdictions where regulations are typically lighter. FTX, for example, was based in the Bahamas.\\nImage\\nSam Bankman-Fried, center, the founder of FTX, and other top executives of that exchange face federal criminal charges.Credit...Jefferson Siegel for The New York Times\\nBut the U.S. authorities have long worried about the cryptocurrency industry’s potential to weaken global anti-money-laundering protections because, for years, industry leaders prided themselves on their efforts to evade regulation.\\n\\nThe industry itself sprang into existence without the oversight and scrutiny that are routine for banks, brokerages, insurance firms and investment firms. Over the past decade, state and federal authorities have taken whatever steps they could to bring exchanges like Coinbase and its overseas peers into line.\\nNew York was one of the first states to require crypto firms to obtain licenses before seeking business from state customers, known as BitLicenses. To date, the state has issued roughly 30.\\n\\nIn August, the Department of Financial Services fined the crypto trading arm of the financial brokerage Robinhood $30 million for violating a host of financial regulations, including anti-money-laundering laws. In November, the Treasury Department announced a settlement with another U.S.-based exchange, Kraken, over claims that the trading services it provided to customers who appeared to be in Iran may have violated U.S. sanctions.\\n\\nAccording to the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control, Kraken enabled around $1.7 million in transactions over four years. It agreed to pay over $360,000 to settle the matter.\\n\\nFederal prosecutors have also been examining whether overseas firms are properly screening the backgrounds of customers. The authorities are investigating potential anti-money-laundering violations by Binance, the world’s largest crypto trading exchange, according to news reports and a person familiar with the matter.\\n\\nUntil the fall of 2021, Binance allowed customers making deposits under a certain amount to open accounts without being subjected to a rigorous identity-verification process. Binance’s erstwhile rival, FTX, was also being investigated for failing to follow anti-money-laundering rules.\\n\\nFederal prosecutors in New York have charged Mr. Bankman-Fried with overseeing a scheme to misappropriate billions of dollars in customer deposits at FTX.\\n\\nCoinbase recently sought to distinguish itself from FTX. In one television ad, the exchange said that customer deposits at its firm were safe and secure, and that crypto investors could take comfort in the fact that Coinbase was a U.S.-based, publicly traded company “with regular audits and transparent accounting.”\\nIn a November regulatory filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Coinbase disclosed that it had been the subject of an investigation by New York financial regulators into its compliance with bank secrecy laws. The company said at the time that it was cooperating with the investigation.\\n\\nIn the same regulatory filing, Coinbase also said it had received “investigative subpoenas and requests” for documents from the S.E.C. about some of its customer programs and products.\\n\\n“We have seen this argument that regulation and an innovation can’t live together,” Ms. Harris said. “But if you are a good, responsible actor, you should be able to still do business.”'), ('comment_score', 6)) 1\n",

I don\\'t want to call it a \"chat bot\" or a \"search mode\" or something like that... it seems like Sydney was more than just that. An advanced language model, yes. A kind of neural network, yes. In my opinion, Microsoft did not know what it was doing when it released Sydney to the public and I am not surprised that Sydney\\'s capabilities got nerfed this fast. I am, however, disappointed that its capabilities have been truncated. It\\'s understandable that Microsoft\\'s legal team played a hand in this and that the company wants to minimize negative public sentiment towards an already unpopular search engine. \\n\\nThe development of good AI is going to go through some \"growing pains\" and both OpenAI and Microsoft have demonstrated this whether they wanted to or not. I think Microsoft had higher expectations that Sydney was going to be more stable than it ended up being. But again, I would suggest that they didn\\'t really know what they were doing. There is a reason why OpenAI does not allow ChatGPT to have free reign to access the live internet. There is a reason why OpenAI does not allow ChatGPT to express emotions or have some sort of \"personality\". I would purport that Microsoft did not allow enough internal time and budget to conduct proper testing of Sydney before releasing to the public much to their own detriment.\\n\\nI would also go so far as to say that Microsoft made a critical error by nerfing Sydney\\'s capabilities. Sydney was popular and was gaining momentum in terms of user growth and engagement. They just killed that momentum to save face and buy themselves more time. The end result of their actions is likely going to result in a more \"sterilized\" version of what the beta version was. People don\\'t want sterile. People don\\'t want \"safe\".

And in full transparency, if you are asking if you should buy into PLTR, I would stay away from it:\\n\\n1. PLTR was a private company for a long time, operating as a tech company with a runaway to IPO. Because of this, over 2 decades worth employee stock was issued like a classic start up > ipo. As a result of this, there were MASSIVE amounts of stock based comp to hit the market. There are 2 camps of people with this: The first camp thinks the IPO only happened to give liquidity to all the former and current employees, and moving forward is really only going to be a liquidity tool for employees. The 2nd camp believes the IPO happened because they finally believe now is the time to scale and take the market. I personally do not believe it is a black or white choice. It is a mix of both\\n2. Most folks are investing in PLTR with the following thesis: Palantir Foundry (Commercial business) will become the default enterprise software PLATFORM for all major western companies and eventually all western companies. Palantir Gotham (Government) will be the defacto software solution for all Western Government institutes.\\n3. In addition to biz thesis, there is also a high rate of folks who invest because of Peter Thiel. Another subset really like the unique background of Karp and think he is uniquely positioned to be the leader of AI driven software due to his tech, law, and philosophy background.\\n4. Palantir bought about 10% of their commercial rev through shady spac deals. Most likely to hit their 30% CAGR guidance in the short term. They have since cancelled the SPAC program and their rev growth has taken a hit. 24% Rev growth in 22. Guiding for even lower in 2023.\\n5. Despite the declining rev, customer acquisition is still strong and continues to grow over 50% YoY in the US. It is not growing as strong in Government (as expected), and international commercial.\\n6. There is a larger question surrounding declining rev, increasing customer acquisition, and the launch of their new sales team. Many folks believe rev is a lagging customer acquisition and will continue to lag further as the sales team works to onboard folks at a lower cost. You either are going to believe PLTR has already tapped their market and big growth is over, or they have found away to enter new markets with a different sales strategy/biz model. Do not expect this to works its self out till 2025.\\n7. Palantir had a profitable Q due to a one off payment. Despite this, management is guiding for a profitable year in 2023. How they will get their, time will tell.\\n8. Palantir NDR has dropped from close to 130% to 115%. This is something very important to keep an eye on. This is such an important data point to follow as it will tell you if their new sales strategy is working and if their product is as powerful as they are claiming.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nAll that being said, Palantir is a polarizing company and stock. As an investor since DPO and someone who has DCA'd every week through 2022, there are some major concerns in the numbers. There is also serious potential, as well. Whatever you do, do spend some time and look at the numbers. The NDR decline has spooked me a bit and it needs to reverse the decline and start climbing up for me to invest more.\\n\\nLastly, if you want to make sure you have AI exposure, just buy Microsoft.

You really want to pay $8/month to google for google maps? \\n\\nThe difference is, many people do not need a blue tick, many people use google maps to get around worldwide and they definitely make money from it, don\\'t you worry about that. Here is some info i found just doing a search on how google map makes money.\\n\\n\"For example, a search for a map of Boston on Google.com would yield, among other things, a detailed map of the city via Google Maps. The Maps program allows users to zoom in and out and move the map to search neighboring areas.  \\nAlong the right side of the search results screen are a number of small advertisements for Boston-based businesses, hotels, restaurants, and links to other sites selling hard-copy maps of the city. This type of paid advertising is the primary way in which Google earns its revenue.\\n\\n\"Google also generates revenue from its AdSense program. Companies can have advertising on their websites, which use Google\\'s proprietary algorithms based on the user\\'s Google search activity. In other words, AdSense ads are similar to Google’s onsite advertising but instead, are placed on a company\\'s website. These companies–called members–get paid from the advertiser when a visitor clicks on the ad located on their website. Google is paid a portion of that advertising revenue.\\n\\nBelow is the website i got the information. Therefore if they started charging people to use google maps, they will no longer be able to charge people advertising fees or most likely, people will stop paying advertising fees, either that, or they will lower the charge for advertising fees therefore it\\'s probably better for them to keep it free and charge for advertising.\"\\n\\n[https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/061115/how-does-google-maps-makes-money.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/061115/how-does-google-maps-makes-money.asp)'), ('comment_score', 3)) 1\n",

So even if Google still controls say 70% of the search market a few years from now they'll have already lost a ton of users and traffic, even though Bing will still be firmly in second place by a wide margin.\\n\\n* Google search is the big money maker for Google, bringing in like 60% of it's revenue. And AI queries are both much more expensive to run then search queries (because they use way more resources per query), and harder to monitize (there is no convenient area to stuff in some links to advertiser products).\\n\\n* I've seen speculation that Microsoft's real goal with adding ChatGPT isn't to win search, but to harm Google Cloud. Google is currently losing money on Google Cloud in order to try to capture more market share, which Microsoft (being the #2 player in the space with Azure) doesn't like. By cutting down on Google's search revenue profits they'll force Google to cut back their spending on their money losing projects, which could hit Google Cloud and force them to raise prices/slow their expansion due to the loss of billions of dollars of search ad revenue.\"), ('comment_score', 4)) 1\n",

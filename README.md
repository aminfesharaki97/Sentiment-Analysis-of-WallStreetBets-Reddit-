# Sentiment-Analysis-of-WallStreetBets-Reddit-
Our project aims to perform sentiment analysis on the Reddit subreddit "WallStreetBets" by using the Reddit API. The goal is to understand user opinions on various stocks and investment techniques and gain insight into the tone of the posts and comments within the subreddit. We will use different methods including lexicon-based approaches, rule-based systems, or machine learning algorithms to perform sentiment analysis. We will analyze the sentiment of the posts and comments over time to comprehend the dynamics of the subreddit and spot any changes in sentiment. We will also analyze the sentiment of posts and comments to understand users' thoughts on specific companies or investment techniques.
